## Acronyms:
- BMS : Building Management Systems
- BAS : Building Automation Systems
- BACnet : Building Automation and Control Networks

## Theory:
### Introduction:
- Building Management Systems (BMS), also known as Building Automation Systems (BAS), are computer-based systems installed in buildings to control and monitor the building's mechanical and electrical equipment, such as HVAC, lighting, energy, fire systems, and security systems.
- BMS serves as a central control point for all facilities within a building.
### Examples of what the BMS controls:
1. **HVAC Management:** The BMS oversees duct conditions, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and exhaust heat levels, triggering alerts if they stray from preset thresholds and ensuring maximal HVAC energy efficiency.
2. **Hot Water and Heating Control:** Temperature regulation and pump operations for hot water and central heating are managed by the BMS, assuring proper distribution and functionality.
3. **Chilled Water Oversight:** Chiller functions, including temperature control and pump operations, are supervised by the BMS to guarantee proper coolant distribution.
4. **Lighting Control:** The system automates lighting operations, adjusting for optimal use and energy savings while maintaining comfort and safety standards.
5. **Electrical Consumption Tracking:** The BMS monitors electrical usage and the status of main power switches, offering insights into energy consumption and potential savings.
6. **Fire Safety Sprinkler Oversight**: Monitoring of the sprinkler system is incorporated to ensure adherence to fire safety protocols.
7. **Security Systems Management:** Surveillance and access control are integrated into the BMS, bolstering building security and response to incidents
