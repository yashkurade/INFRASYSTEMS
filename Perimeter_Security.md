### Introduction:
- Perimeter security or perimeter protection are security solutions that utilize physical and software technology systems to protect from unauthorized access and intrusion, aiming to safeguard people, places, and property.
- Perimeter security can include video analytics, video management, access control, fence sensors, buried sensors, above-ground sensors, security management, and physical security measures such as fences, gates, lighting, and barriers.
### Benefits of Perimeter Protection:
- Perimeter Protection: Your First Line of Defense
- Preemptive Measures: Detect, Deter, Delay
- Boosted Operational Continuity
- Enhanced Peace of Mind

### Real life examples:
- FFT Cams 3
	- The AC2000 Future Fiber Technologies (FFT) Central Alarms Monitoring System 3 (CAMS 3) interface for perimeter detection allows alarms and events, controllers and zones from a FFT CAMS 3 installation to be incorporated into AC2000
- Southwest Microwave
	- The AC2000 Southwest Microwave interface for perimeter detection allows alarms and events, detection systems and zones from Southwest Microwave’s INTREPID™ Series II perimeter intrusion detection system (PIDS) to be incorporated into AC2000. This enables AC2000 to act as the central Security Management System (SMS).
### Case study:
- Harland and Wolff rigs have up to 1,200 people onboard and have potentially hazardous environments. The company needed a real-time solution to know who’s on board and manage personnel and activities.
- With CEM Systems AC2000 access control software, Harland and Wolff secured the vast site, enhanced the safety of all employees and visitors, and improved business efficiency.
- The new system was extremely effective. For example, the time to muster all people on the rig for an evacuation drill declined from 45 minutes to nine minutes.
