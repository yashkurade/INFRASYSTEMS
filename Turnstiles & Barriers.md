### introduction:
- Turnstiles:
	- Turnstiles are physical or electronic access control devices that allow one person to pass at a time. 
	- They often incorporate sensors, access control systems, and rotating arms or barriers to manage pedestrian flow. 
	- **Types:**
	    - **Tripod Turnstiles:** Features a three-arm barrier that rotates to allow passage. 
	    - **Speed Gates:** Utilize sliding or swinging barriers for faster access control. 
	    - **Full Height Turnstiles:** Provide a high level of security with barriers extending from floor to ceiling. 
	    - **Flap Barriers:** Use retractable wings or flaps to control access. 
	- **Applications:**
	    - **Public Transportation:** To manage access to trains, buses, and subways. 
	    - **Office Buildings:** To control access for employees and visitors. 
	    - **Sporting Venues:** To manage entry and exit for events. 
	    - **Schools and Universities:** To regulate student and staff access. 
	    - **Secure Facilities:** To restrict access to sensitive areas. 
	- **Benefits:**
	    - **Improved Security:** Prevent unauthorized access and tailgating. 
	    - **Efficient Traffic Management:** Handle large crowds and regulate pedestrian flow. 
	    - **Cost-effective:** Compared to other security measures, turnstiles can be a cost-effective solution, according to MairsTurnstile. 
	    - **Integration with Access Control:** Can be integrated with various access control systems like biometric scanners or card readers. 
	    - **Visitor Management:** Can be used to track and manage visitors in buildings. 

- Barriers:
	- Barriers, like boom barriers, are physical obstructions used to control vehicle access.
	- They typically consist of a pivoting arm or pole that can be raised or lowered to allow or block passage.
	- **Applications:**
	    - **Parking Lots:** To manage access to parking spaces.
	    - **Toll Booths:** To control traffic flow at toll plazas.
	    - **Secure Areas:** To restrict access to restricted zones.
	- **Benefits:**
	    - **Vehicle Traffic Management:** Control vehicle flow and prevent unauthorized access.
	    - **Integration with Access Control:** Can be integrated with various access control systems for automated entry.
	    - **Safety:** Can be used to prevent accidents by restricting access to hazardous areas. 
    
### Key Differences:
- **Focus:**
	Turnstiles are primarily for pedestrian access, while barriers are for vehicle access. 
- **Technology:**
	Turnstiles often incorporate more advanced technology for access control, while barriers are generally simpler in design. 
- **Security Level:**
	Turnstiles can offer a higher level of security, especially full-height turnstiles, while barriers are more suitable for controlling vehicle traffic. 
- **Cost:**
	The cost of turnstiles can vary widely depending on the type and features, while barriers are generally more affordable.

- Johnson Controls provides security solutions, including turnstiles and access control systems, for various applications like government buildings and commercial spaces. They offer a range of products, from basic optical turnstiles to advanced speed gates, to enhance security and manage access.
