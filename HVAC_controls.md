## Acronyms:
- HVAC - Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
- AFUE - Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency
- HSPF2 - Heating Seasonal Performance Factor
- SEER2 - Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ration
- EER2 - Energy Efficiency Ratio
- BTU - British Thermal Unit

## Theory:
### Introduction:
- A residential HVAC system is a complete home comfort system that can heat and cool your home, as well as provide improved indoor air quality and humidity control. There are many different types of HVAC systems. They can include individual components such as AC units, heat pumps, air handlers, furnaces, air cleaners, humidifiers, and dehumidifiers.
- The more efficient an HVAC unit is, the more it can help you reduce your energy consumption and save on your energy bills.
### Energy efficiency terms:
- AFUE
	AFUE stands for Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency and applies to a gas furnace or boiler’s efficiency. An AFUE rating is expressed as a percentage -  a ratio of how much energy is produced via the combustion process and how much fuel burned is lost or wasted. A 97% AFUE rating means 97% of the fuel burned goes directly to heating your home. 
- HSPF2
	HSPF2 stands for Heating Seasonal Performance Factor. This rating applies exclusively to heat pumps, and measures how efficiently a heat pump can heat your home during the colder months. This energy efficiency rating was also recently updated.   
- SEER2
	SEER2 stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ration. The 2 on the end was added when the efficiency standards were updated. SEER2 measures the AVERAGE cooling efficiency of an air conditioner or heat pump over a range of temperatures from 65-104 degrees Fahrenheit.
- EER2
	Similar to SEER2, EER2 (Energy Efficiency Ratio) measures the efficiency of cooling units, but at a specific temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. This standard was also recently updated from EER. A higher EER2 rating might be more important than the SEER2 rating of an AC unit or heat pump if you live in a hot climate.
- BTU
	BTU stands for British Thermal Unit. A BTU is a measurement of heat energy. Specifically, one BTU equals the amount of heat required to raise or lower the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In general, you need an HVAC unit with a higher number of BTUs to heat or cool a larger space. Work with an HVAC professional to determine proper sizing for your home.

### Types of HVAC systems:
- Split system
	A split system is the most common central heating and air conditioning system in single-family homes in the US. It is a matched system that includes an outdoor unit such as a heat pump or air conditioner and an indoor unit such as an air handler or furnace.  
- Dual fuel heat pump system
	A dual-fuel heat pump system consists of an outdoor electric heat pump and an indoor gas furnace. The heat pump provides cooling in the summer and the furnace circulates the cool air inside your home. In colder weather, you have a dual-fuel heating system.
	The heat pump/furnace combo, sometimes called a hybrid HVAC system, chooses the most efficient way to heat your home. In the fall and early spring, the heat pump heats your home until the temperatures drop below 40 degrees. Then the furnace kicks in to keep your home warm and cozy.
- Ductless mini-split system
	Ductless HVAC systems are great for older homes without ductwork, new construction, or areas that need a boost in heating and cooling. A ductless mini-split system has an outdoor condenser/compressor unit (sometimes called a mini-split heat pump) and one or more indoor units.
	A true mini-split system has one unit, while a multi-zone ductless system can have up to 8 connected indoor units. You can set each unit at its own temperature or turn it off. You cannot heat and cool at the same time, however.
- Packaged system
	A packaged HVAC system contains the heating and cooling units in one sleek cabinet. HVAC packaged units are a good solution for smaller homes that don’t have room for a larger split system.
